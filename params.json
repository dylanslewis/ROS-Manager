{"name":"ROS-Manager","tagline":"","body":"Manager\r\n==========\r\n\r\n## Introduction\r\n\r\nThis App is part of the Restaurant Ordering System, and is designed to work alongside [Waiter](http://dylanslewis.github.io/ROS-Waiter/) and [Kitchen](http://dylanslewis.github.io/ROS-Kitchen/). \r\n\r\n## Current functionality\r\n\r\nManager currently only has core functionality and is still in development. However, the current version provides the following functionality:\r\n\r\n### Login and Signup\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://i57.tinypic.com/2zyejau.png\" align=\"center\" height=\"445\" width=\"250\">\r\n\r\nRestaurants can signup to the system within the app, and then login.\r\n\r\n### Menu\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://i57.tinypic.com/dg0y6e.png\" align=\"center\" height=\"445\" width=\"250\">\r\n\r\nCourses are divided into two types: food and drink. This is used to direct orders of these items to the correct areas of the restaurant. Navigating and creating the menu is simple and familiar to iOS users.\r\n\r\n### Dish options\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://i62.tinypic.com/2unu1op.png\" align=\"center\" height=\"445\" width=\"250\">\r\n\r\nOrdering a dish from a menu needs to be flexible, as not all customers want their food exactly the same. Dish options allow managers to ensure vital information is provided for orders, such as *Rare*, *Medium Rare* or *Well Done* steaks, or *125ml*, *200ml* or *Bottle* sizes for ordering wine. The options' functionality will later be extended to cover entire courses and to allow more complicated customisations of dishes.\r\n\r\n### Managing current orders\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://i57.tinypic.com/2yvjnkx.png\" align=\"center\" height=\"445\" width=\"250\">\r\n\r\nManagers want to have access to everything that is currently happening in the restaurant, and the Overview page lets them see all open orders, grouped by their waiter. Future functionality will allow a more visual approach to this problem, and will enable managers to accept discounts before they are applied to orders, putting them in full control of their restaurant.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Known issues\r\n\r\nThe app has the following known issues:  \r\n- unexpected crashes may occur as a result of heavy memory usage, which will be resolved in future iterations;  \r\n- fonts may not appear correctly at first throughout the app;  \r\n- the Reports page currently has no functionality;\r\n- scenes do not always refresh their data after the user's action, and may require navigating away from and back to the page;\r\n- Export Menu currently has no functionality;\r\n- Currency values are not currently truncated to two decimal places.\r\n\r\n\r\n## How to use\r\n\r\nIf you want to download and explore the App, please submit a pull request and use the following login credentials to view an account with pre-loaded data:  \r\nusername: *tester*  \r\npassword: *password*\r\n\r\n*Please note that Manager has only been designed to work on an iPhone 6 running iOS 8, currently. It will run on other devices running iOS 8, but you may experience layout issues.*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Future work\r\n\r\nThe Restaurant Ordering System is an ongoing project. Now that simple functionality has been implemented, the developer is working on enhancing the experience for chefs, and to cover less common use cases.","google":"UA-56777787-3","note":"Don't delete this file!
